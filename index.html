                         <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                         only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                         creating a single web page with a menu at the top, known as a
                         Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                         text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                         two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                         related to the project itself.</p>

                         <h3>Project 2</h3>
                         <p>Cycloneopoly is an Android based app I developed as part of a team of four. 
                         This app was made to be a mobile version of the board game Monopoly with an 
                         Iowa State University theme. We worked to complete this project over the 
                         span of a semester as a part of our classwork for COM S 309. 
                         The goal was to be able to make a fully function app that could operate 
                         out of a server and run multiple different games at any one time. 
                         The app would also be able to run both multiplayer as pass and play, 
                         with bots or across the server.</p>
